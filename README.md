# Node.js Session Secret Generator

This Node.js script generates a new session secret using the crypto module and saves it to a file named secret.txt.
The script can be used to create a new secret for a session cookie in a Node.js or Express application.

# Installation

    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
    Clone this repository or download the ZIP archive and extract it to a folder on your computer.
    Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project folder.

## Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
    Run the script by entering npm run generate or npm start.
    If the secret.txt file does not exist, a new one will   be created and the secret will be saved to it.
    If the secret.txt file already exists, it will be deleted and replaced with a new one containing the new secret.
    The script will log a message to the console indicating that a new secret has been generated and saved to the file.
    Use the secret value from the secret.txt file in your Node.js or Express application as needed.
